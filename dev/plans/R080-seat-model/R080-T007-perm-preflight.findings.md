# R080-T007 findings

Notes the second cold read still reported and no planner fixed, one
bullet per gap. `write-plan.md` step 6 sends what a last read finds here
rather than to another planner pass. The implementer reads them with the
plan.

- **Item 2, when the client reads a settings tier: settled, the plan
  stands.** The one-content rule rests on the tier's working-tree file
  being what the session's own permission check reads, and the resume
  that follows has the user edit a tier at the halt and re-enter
  `§ Pre-flight` with no restart. A probe on this host settles it: with
  `deny: ["Bash(git tag:*)"]` added to `.claude/settings.local.json`
  mid-session, `git tag --list` was denied while `git status --short`
  ran; with the key removed, `git tag --list` ran. The client re-reads
  a tier live, in both directions, so a deny the pre-flight reports
  present is a deny that binds the halted session. Cite the fact rather
  than re-deriving it; it is R080's to promote
  (`tasks.md § Archival, promotion target`).

- **Item 4, `present (local)` is stated without its qualifier.** "Its
  seeded local tier satisfies both entries - `present (local)` under the
  first item's rule" holds only where no earlier tier carries the pair;
  item 1 states the same claim with that qualifier and item 4's
  acceptance drops it. A worker cloning a project whose tracked
  `.claude/settings.json` carries the pair - as this repository's does -
  prints `present (project)` under the tier order. The gate still
  passes, and the shipped text is already qualified: item 4's approach
  states the tier order instead, and `scripts/worker-workspace.sh`'s
  `settings()` comment reads "each reported against the first tier that
  carries it". The over-strong wording is the acceptance sentence alone.

## Approach notes

- **Item 4, the LAYOUT node's padding.** "Which the 24-character name
  reaches with six spaces" miscounts: siblings put `#` at 34 characters,
  which a 24-character name reaches with two spaces.
