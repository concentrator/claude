# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Note:** If subagents are available (Claude Code, Codex), prefer `subagent-driven-development` for higher quality.

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## When to Stop and Ask

**Stop immediately:** blocker (missing dep, test fails, instruction unclear); critical plan gap; you don't understand an instruction; verification fails repeatedly. Ask for clarification rather than guessing.

**Return to Step 1 when:** partner updates the plan based on your feedback, or the fundamental approach needs rethinking.

Don't force through blockers — stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent

## Integration

**Required workflow skills:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - REQUIRED: Set up isolated workspace before starting
- **writing-plans** - Creates the plan this skill executes
- **finishing-a-development-branch** - Complete development after all tasks
