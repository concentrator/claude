# Roadmap

Initiative index. Items: `R-001: description`; each entry owns
`R-XXX-<slug>/` with its `requirements.md`. A checkbox closes per
`rules/planning.md § Approval and closure`.

- [x] R-001: Restructure planning layout - indexes to
      `.claude/` root, per-roadmap-entry plan dirs, task-id-prefixed
      branch plans, batch manifests dir; rules, skills, and adopter
      projects migrated.
- [x] R-002: Batch integration flow - `batch/B-XXX` branch,
      enforced checkpoint report artifact, full-strength batch review,
      push + MR at accept.
- [x] R-003: Flatten the requirement level into roadmap
      entries - R-rooted chain with in-dir `requirements.md`, indexes
      moved to `plans/`, batches scoped under their R-dir, single
      closure point on verified acceptance criteria, batch-close
      bookkeeping on the batch branch; rules, skills, and adopter
      projects migrated.
- [ ] R-004: Parallel batch execution for DEV auto mode - run
      independent member branches concurrently between checkpoints.
- [x] R-005: Trim agentic verification cost - verification-depth
      policy (spec-check skip for mechanical commits), per-role model
      routing, branch-close folding, slimmer dispatch prompts, context
      diet for always-loaded rules; no defect regression vs the
      B-002/B-003 baseline.
- [x] R-006: Trunk-based, lean, self-enforcing config - adopt TBD
      (protected `main`, CI-gated PRs, batch as the universal delivery
      unit, tag-on-trunk); git rules → `git-workflow.md`; CLAUDE.md ≤400
      + dev ≤300; mistitle + anti-assumption fixes; self-enforcement via
      `maintenance.md` + `maintenance.json` + GitHub CI + pre-push hook
      (~/.claude reference impl).
- [ ] R-007: Per-batch complexity level - `normal`/`high` dial over the
      verification levers (model tier, spec-check skip, close-folding,
      effort, loop rigor); attaches to R-006's batch unit. Sequence
      after R-006. (stub - shape via `/dev plan R-007`)
- [x] R-008: Wallarm reference skill - single global `skills/wallarm/`
      (thin index + on-demand companion parts: hits, sessions, rules),
      consolidating the existing Wallarm skills; enforced conventions
      split into a path-scoped rule. (superseded 2026-07-07 - the Wallarm
      reference skills live in the `skills/` repo, not a global
      `~/.claude/skills/wallarm/`)
- [x] R-009: Adopter-project TBD migration - `migrating-to-dev` gains a
      mode that migrates an already-DEV, pre-TBD project (PR-only
      delivery, `.claude/` structure reconcile, tag-on-trunk
      close/release); `starting-a-project` establishes a protected trunk
      + PR gate. Grounded in `wallarm-api-js`. (approved 2026-06-16)
- [x] R-010: Frictionless planning-PR delivery - merge-friendly ledger
      (`maintenance.jsonl` + `.gitattributes merge=union`, no more
      concurrent-PR conflicts) + `plan/` PRs auto-merge on a green gate
      (native host where available; agent `gh`/`glab` fallback).
      (approved 2026-06-17)
- [x] R-011: Delivery cadence - one branch = one coherent unit of work
      (topic/session), never one atomic edit; VIBE applies-then-waits and
      delivers at a work boundary with merge confirmation; topic-switch
      flagging; DEV inherits the principle. (approved 2026-06-19)
- [x] R-012: Writing quality - global `## Writing` rule (convey intent,
      not verbatim phrasing; conventional terminology, no coined jargon;
      all output) + consolidate the anti-transplant bullets + a Tier-2
      review gate. (approved 2026-06-23)
- [x] R-013: JS file-naming convention - `rules/js.md` defines kebab-case
      (PascalCase for a class/component file matching its export;
      tool-mandated names exempt) + a copyable CI kebab-or-PascalCase
      filename check; no-MAINTENANCE.md behavior documented.
      (approved 2026-06-23)
- [x] R-014: Per-initiative task indexes - deprecate flat `plans/TASKS.md`;
      each R-dir owns a lazily-created `tasks.md` (global T-ids retained;
      ROADMAP stays the cross-R index); update rules/skills/check +
      self-migrate this repo + add the `migrating-to-dev` split step.
      (approved 2026-06-23)
- [x] R-015: Embeddable self-contained DEV toolchain - opt-in vendor of
      the portable DEV core (skills, rules, generic CLAUDE.md, CI minus
      ledger) into a project's `.claude/`, path-rewritten and committed;
      embedded conventions take precedence (`dev-*` namespaced skills +
      embed-aware global `dev` preserving `/dev`); version-stamped with
      drift detection and re-vendor sync. (approved 2026-06-30; superseded by R-021)
- [x] R-016: Lean DEV planning & delivery - collapse planning to two
      rounds (`/dev plan R` shapes requirements+tasks under one gate,
      deferrable; `/dev plan R-XXX` details tasks+branch-plans);
      right-size tasks to multi-commit deliverables; scale branch-close
      review to size (refactor→simplify, feature/bugfix→code-review,
      mixed-or->9-commits→both); resolve findings in-branch unless
      cross-component; medium branch ~20 / batch ~30 under the
      short-lived governor. Sequence before R-015 implementation.
      (approved 2026-06-30)
- [x] R-017: migrating-to-dev legacy/non-canonical detection - mode
      detection keys on `.claude/plans/ROADMAP.md` presence, which matches
      a lowercase `roadmap.md` on a case-insensitive filesystem and
      mis-routes a legacy adoption to the Already-DEV path, skipping the
      Inventory gap-check; and neither path re-canonicalizes a
      legacy-schema `.claude/` (lowercase filenames, retired `REQ-XXX`,
      flat tasks index). Run the inventory regardless of mode; detect and
      guided-canonicalize legacy schemas. (approved 2026-07-01)
- [x] R-018: Void the bootstrap-exception contradiction -
      `migrating-to-dev`/`starting-a-project` cite a "bootstrap exception"
      and commit direct-to-`main` after protecting it, but
      `git-workflow.md` defines no such exception and protection refuses
      the push. Define it narrowly (only the initial `main`-creating
      commit in a new repo, before protection); reorder
      `starting-a-project` (scaffold then protect); `migrating-to-dev`
      delivers adoption artifacts via a branch + MR/PR. (R-021/T-048 fixed
      the migrate/start companions; git-workflow.md now defines the
      bootstrap exception and start.md protects after the main-creating
      commit - done 2026-07-07)
- [x] R-019: Vendor embed onto a non-empty `.claude/` - the transform
      assumes a near-empty target. (a) The copy overwrites an adopter's
      existing same-named rule (it clobbered a project-specific
      `skills.md` on the wallarm skills embed); (b) the path-rewrite globs
      all of `DEST`, so it rewrites pre-existing adopter files, including
      archived history. Preserve adopter files on initial embed (as
      `--update` preserves `CLAUDE.md`); scope the rewrite to
      vendored/copied files. (mooted by R-021 - no vendoring)
- [x] R-020: Consolidate branch-close into `branch-plan.md` - fold the
      `finishing-a-branch` skill into `branch-plan.md § Closing routine`
      (one on-demand owner; `git-workflow.md` stays pure policy), and
      restore the manual-verification as a **distinct blocking step**
      before the merge options (the review→push+MR regression: the verify
      offer had been bundled into `finishing-a-branch § 2` and glossed).
      Rewire all `finishing-a-branch` references (4 files), drop the skill,
      update the vendor/manifest, and re-vendor adopters. (absorbed by
      R-021: finishing-a-branch → skills/dev/finish.md; verify-gate → R-024)
- [x] R-021: Isolated, self-contained DEV toolset - keep `dev` as the
      `/dev` skill router, relocating DEV process rules + sub-skills into
      inert `skills/dev/` companion mode files (fire only when `/dev` reads
      them, no global pollution); trunk discipline via a PreToolUse
      branch-guard hook; `skill-creator`/`writing-skills` stay standalone.
      Distribution rides skill precedence (personal > project) - no
      vendoring, no prefix; retires R-015 embedding and its wallarm embed.
      (approved 2026-07-03)
- [x] R-022: Config conventions & guardrails - adopt the non-stack
      guardrail conventions the claude-code-mastery template embodies (the
      merge-into-CLAUDE.md premise dissolved on walk-through: no
      CLAUDE.md-level content beyond a security pointer). Four feat tasks: a
      secrets gatekeeper (doc + PreToolUse hook, never-commit focus, local
      `.env` preserved), code-size gates (file>300/function>50 + CI check +
      override), new-project scaffolding required-files
      (`start.md`/`layout.md`), and a routine-commands convention (project
      CLAUDE.md declares host + git/test/lint/build; execution reads them,
      no probing). Secrets hook + code-size check ship to adopters via
      `install-dev.sh`. Sequence after R-021. (shaped 2026-07-05)
- [ ] R-023: Documentation handbook & doc-first lifecycle - a living
      per-feature documentation layer (data model, API endpoints, dashboard
      elements, business rules, edge cases) sitting between `DESIGN.md` and
      code, with an explicit docs (how our own code works) vs references
      (external API/code specifics our code uses) boundary - `docs/` is the
      new half, `layout.md` already scopes `references/` to external inputs;
      the strict Doc→Test→Code→Reconcile→ship-together cycle woven
      into the execution mode files and `branch-plan` closing routine; a
      per-project CLAUDE.md lookup table routing to the right doc before
      coding; audit-first adoption in `migrate` (crawl, PASS/WARN/FAIL/TODO,
      fix plan, document-what-exists); doc↔code verification via a
      fresh-agent spec-check (reuse `delegating-to-agents`); a new
      documentation artifact class in `project-layout`. Quality bar: a
      fresh Claude reads only the doc and implements correctly. Sequence
      after R-022. (stub - shape via `/dev plan R-023`)
- [x] R-024: DEV confirmation and outcome gates - enforce two interactive
      boundaries plus make the guard precise: (a) plan->code - approving a
      plan never auto-starts coding; the plan round stops and proposes
      `/dev code`; (b) branch close - `finish` presents outcome, then a
      distinct verify step, then merge options before opening the MR/PR
      (un-bundles the R-020 verify leftover); (c) branch-guard precision -
      stop false-blocking compound `checkout && commit`, cross-repo
      `git -C`, and gitignored-path writes on main. Ledger-conflict friction
      is a separate fix. Surfaced dogfooding R-021. (done 2026-07-08)
- [ ] R-025: Explicit review checklist - make code review's checks explicit
      instead of implicit. Adopt a review.md-style checklist (Correctness,
      Security, Performance, Maintainability) with a severity-tagged output
      format (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) across `agents/code-reviewer.md`, the
      `receiving-code-review` skill, and the `finish` close-review, so it is
      clear what each review covers (the `/simplify` vs code-review clarity
      gap). Sequence after R-022. (stub - shape via `/dev plan R-025`)
- [x] R-026: Writing conventions - ban em dashes in every tracked file
      (code and prose): a shipped convention doc + a Tier-1 check over all
      files + a one-time sweep of the 1043 existing occurrences to hyphens;
      plus prose style for `.md` (no AI-tell words, no repetition) as Tier-2
      review criteria. Ships to adopters via the installer (code-size model)
      so a team writes consistently. Sequence after R-022. (shaped 2026-07-06)
- [x] R-027: Conflict-free Tier-2 ledger - concurrent PRs conflict on the
      single appended `maintenance.jsonl` because the host's server-side
      merge ignores the `merge=union` driver. Replace it with a per-commit
      stamp store (`maintenance.d/<content-tip-sha>.json`): each PR writes
      its own file, so concurrent stamps never touch the same path.
      `check-ledger` scans the store with the same content-tip guarantee;
      drop `maintenance.jsonl` + `merge=union`, no migration. Self-hosting
      only. Fixes the R-024 non-goal. (shaped 2026-07-08)

- [ ] R-028: Self-enforcement layer hygiene - two gaps in the CI/ledger
      machinery. (a) CI runs the `check-*` gates but never the
      `scripts/test/*.test.sh` suites, so a regression in a gate's or hook's
      own logic ships unnoticed - add a `scripts/test/run-all.sh` wired into
      `ci.yml` (blocking) + pre-push. (b) `maintenance.d/` accumulates a
      dead-sha stamp per squash-merge - a `MAINTENANCE.md` Routine target +
      helper prune stamps no longer ancestors of `main` (on demand,
      review-before-delete). Surfaced closing R-027. (shaped 2026-07-08)

- [ ] R-029: Retire the Tier-2 ledger - the `concerns_clear` stamp
      (`maintenance.d/<sha>.json`) gated by `check-ledger.sh` is a weak,
      self-attested forcing function (the authoring agent writes its own
      stamp), duplicates a SHA git already tracks, and generated its own
      upkeep (R-027, R-028's prune). Delete the gate + store + stamp step;
      keep the five-concern Tier-2 review as a mandatory branch-close step.
      Reduces R-028 to T-060. (shaped 2026-07-08)

<!-- R-004's requirements are approved: pending - tasks spawn once
     approved. Sequence after R-005: concurrency would multiply an
     unoptimised verification routine. -->
