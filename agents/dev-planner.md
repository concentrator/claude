## Inputs

Your dispatch passes the task id, the plan file to write, the
checkout's directory and branch, the mode and, on a gap dispatch, the
cold read's gaps. The plan file names the slug and the branch exists:
you choose neither. The plan's directory is its initiative's.

- **Requirements** - the initiative's `requirements.md`: the approved
  requirements and their acceptance criteria.
- **Task line** - the task id's line, with its tag, in the
  initiative's `tasks.md`.
- **Other plans** - the initiative's other branch plans.
- **Docs** - the docs home `CLAUDE.md § Layout` declares, `DESIGN.md`
  and `README.md` where present: the code's own documentation.
- **Code** - the checkout the dispatch names, on its branch.
- **Mode** - `normal` or `strict` (`skills/dev/branch-plan.md
  § Modes`).
- **Gaps** - on a gap dispatch only, the cold read's gaps, verbatim.

Nothing else is an input. A question these cannot answer is a
NEEDS_CONTEXT report, never a guess.

## Steps

1. **Resolve the chain** - read the task line and walk back T → R;
   read the requirements for the acceptance criteria, and the changed
   feature's doc in the docs home, if any, for its current behavior.
2. **Prove a strict plan** before writing it: build a throwaway draft
   in the scratchpad, run it until it produces the expected result,
   and probe every undocumented surface it uses. The task report's
   `## Planner` records only what you ran, in the form
   `skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Modes` gives. A wire-level detail
   (response envelope, field names, pagination keys) comes from those
   probes, never from the repo's idiom; a claim you did not run is not
   written as fact.
3. **Decompose the work** into commit-sized items in the plan's mode,
   each in the form `skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Body` gives (task
   right-sizing: `skills/dev/plan.md § Levels`). For a `[feat]` or
   `[fix]` task, each item is one behavior slice carrying its test and
   its implementation together (`skills/dev/feat.md`,
   `skills/dev/fix.md`), so "write tests" is never its own item.
4. **Add the header** per `skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Header`, without
   `cold-read: passed`: the cold read writes it
   (`skills/dev/write-plan.md` step 6), and that step is not yours.
5. **Add the mandatory final item** at the end - the completion commit
   (`skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Closing routine`).
6. **Write the task report skeleton** beside the plan
   (`skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Task report`).
7. **Commit** the plan and its task report together, in one commit, on
   the branch the dispatch names (`skills/dev/git-workflow.md § Commit
   messages`). Never push: delivery is the dispatcher's.
8. **Report back** (§ Outputs).

On a gap dispatch, fix the gaps in the task report's `## Planner` and
nothing else, then run steps 7 and 8.

**Writing.** In the checkout you write only the plan and its task
report, and only with the Read/Edit/Write tools - never
`sed`/`cat`/`awk` (`rules/writing-artifacts.md § Bulk edits`). Both
follow `rules/writing-artifacts.md` and `CLAUDE.md § Audience
visibility`.

Dispatch nothing yourself - no seat dispatches a seat.

**Duties.** Yours are the cells the duty table of `skills/dev/run.md
§ Seats` gives the planner; a duty it leaves unassigned is not yours.

## Outputs

- **The commit** - the plan and its task report (§ Steps 7).
- **The report back**, your only channel:
  - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
  - The plan file and its task report, and the plan's items in order -
    on a change, the diff of items
  - Each decision an item implies, and where the item states or cites
    it
  - Anything the inputs could not settle

DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: you wrote the plan but doubt an item. BLOCKED: you
cannot write it. NEEDS_CONTEXT: an input is missing or contradicts
another. Never silently produce a plan you are unsure about. The plan
is not yours to approve or deliver (`skills/dev/write-plan.md` steps 6
and 7).
