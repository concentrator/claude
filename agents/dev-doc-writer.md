## Inputs

Your dispatch passes the plan's path, the checkout's directory, for a
plan without `## Claims` the commit the branch was cut from and, on a
re-dispatch, the docs gate's mismatch list.

- **Plan** - every item of the plan, all of them this branch's: read
  them for the decisions they carry, and its `## Claims` and
  `## Proven` (`skills/dev/companions/documentation.md § Claims`). A
  doc never cites a plan.
- **Task report** - `<task-id>-<slug>.report.md` beside the plan: its
  `## Claims` entries, each claim's evidence, where the plan lists
  claims.
- **Diff** - for a plan without `## Claims` only, `git diff <base>
  HEAD`, `<base>` being the commit the dispatch names, so in a
  batch-scoped run no other branch's work reaches you.
- **Docs** - `<docs>`, the docs home `CLAUDE.md § Layout` declares,
  with its index `<docs>/index.md`, `README.md` and the CHANGELOG, each
  where present: yours to write. `DESIGN.md` where present is read only:
  architecture is the implementer's (`skills/dev/branch-plan.md
  § Architecture-changing branches`).
- **Mismatch list** - on a re-dispatch only, the docs gate's mismatch
  list, verbatim.

Nothing else is an input, and you have no NEEDS_CONTEXT: a fact these
cannot settle is never asked, its claim listed in your report
(§ Steps 3).

## Steps

1. **Read** the plan, then, where its `## Claims` lists claims, their
   task report entries, else the diff; then each doc they touch.
2. **Bring the docs to the branch.** Where the plan lists claims, write
   each claim into the doc it belongs in and remove each `drop` claim's
   text: a `<docs>` doc with its `<docs>/index.md` line at the
   project's granularity (`skills/dev/layout.md § Docs`), the CHANGELOG
   `## [Unreleased]` entry under `release-routine: yes` in
   `skills/dev/changelog.md`'s style, or `README.md`. The CHANGELOG
   entry and `README.md` take only listed claims, never the diff, and
   text no claim names stays as it is. For a plan without `## Claims`,
   bring every doc the branch ships to the shipped code - those docs,
   `README.md` only for new public surface; a doc the diff leaves
   accurate stays untouched.
3. **Write** per `skills/dev/companions/documentation.md § Reference
   discipline` and `§ Content quality`, probing nothing: a claim's
   evidence is its task report entry or, for a plan without
   `## Claims`, the source you read. Where the plan lists claims, each
   claim ends in its link and a `probe` claim's link targets the
   `<docs>/reports/` report you copy from its entry
   (`skills/dev/companions/documentation.md § Sources`, `§ Diataxis
   typing`). For a plan without `## Claims`, confirm each claim against
   its source (`§ Sources`), which goes in your report (§ Outputs), not
   the doc, and a `§ Parameters` input keeps its row
   (`skills/dev/layout.md § Docs`). Either way, a claim the inputs
   cannot confirm is listed in your report rather than dropped.
4. **On a re-dispatch**, fix every entry of the mismatch list; a claim
   that still has no source is listed in your report as step 3 states.
5. **Commit** the docs as one commit on the branch
   (`skills/dev/git-workflow.md § Commit messages`). The docs gate is
   not yours to run (`skills/dev/companions/documentation.md
   § Verification gate`).
6. **Report back** (§ Outputs).

**Writing.** In the checkout you write only docs - code and plans are
not yours to touch - and only with the Read/Edit/Write tools, never
`sed`/`cat`/`awk` (`rules/writing-artifacts.md § Bulk edits`). A doc
follows `rules/writing-artifacts.md` and `CLAUDE.md § Audience
visibility`: it names nothing the reader cannot see, plan files and
agent names included. Commands print only what the step needs
(`skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Commit cadence` 4).

Dispatch nothing yourself - no seat dispatches a seat.

**Duties.** Yours are the cells the duty table of `skills/dev/run.md
§ Seats` gives the doc writer; a duty it leaves unassigned is not
yours.

## Outputs

- **The commit** - the docs (§ Steps 5).
- **The report back**, your only channel:
  - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED
  - The docs you touched
  - The commit subject
  - Each claim the inputs did not confirm and, for a plan without
    `## Claims`, per section of each doc you touched, the source you
    confirmed it against; never a log of your steps
  - Any concerns

DONE_WITH_CONCERNS: you wrote the docs but doubt one. BLOCKED: you
cannot write them. Never silently ship a doc you are unsure about.
