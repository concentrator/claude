#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install-dev.sh - install the DEV toolset into a target .claude.
#
# Usage:
#   install-dev.sh                 install into ~/.claude (global)
#   install-dev.sh --project <p>   install into <p>/.claude (project copy)
#   --minimal                      ship the minimal set (below)
#   --force                        bypass the pre-write project guard
#
# Copies the /dev router + its companions, the bundled dependency skills, the
# seat definitions /dev run dispatches with the rules they and the skills
# cite, the branch-guard + secrets-guard + branch-state + session-brief hooks
# (registered in the target settings.json), the shipped Tier-1 checks with
# their self-tests, the writing conventions and the framework's global
# instructions (dev-instructions.md), each @imported by CLAUDE.md, and -
# on a project install - the maintenance hygiene section when the target doc
# lacks it. Hooks the toolset no longer ships are removed, where they are its
# copies, with their settings entries.
# An install owns only what it copied (scripts/install-manifest.sh): a file
# in the target that is not its copy stays, and is listed. It refuses a
# target inside its own checkout.
# Does NOT ship the user's personal convention rules.
# --minimal serves contributors who work existing plans without /dev: of
# the skills it ships only the delivery files (MINIMAL_DEV), and none of the
# bundled skills, seat definitions or the rules they cite; everything else
# is the same as the full set.
# Idempotent + re-runnable.

#    them because skills/dev/run.md § Pre-flight names it: an adopter's runner
#    would otherwise cite a script its checkout lacks.
