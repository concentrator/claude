# Environment design

Architecture of the `~/.claude` configuration: the components, how they
relate, and the invariants that keep them coherent.

## Components

- **CLAUDE.md** — global operating instructions, loaded every session.
  Maintenance: `rules/claude-md.md`.
- **rules/** — personal convention rules (`git-workflow` always-on; `js`,
  `skills`, `claude-md` path-scoped), loaded as memory. The DEV process
  rules now live as `skills/dev/` companions.
- **skills/** — invocable capabilities. `skills/dev/` is the `/dev` router
  + its inert mode-file companions (the DEV toolset); the rest are
  standalone reference skills. Authoring: `skills/skill-creator/`,
  `skills/writing-skills/`, `rules/skills.md`.
- **commands/**, **agents/** — optional slash commands and custom agents.
- **settings.json** — global Claude Code config. Project-scoped settings
  for this repo: `.claude/settings.local.json`.
- **plans/** — this environment's own planning hierarchy
  (`skills/dev/plan.md`).
- **MAINTENANCE.md** — sanity routine + the Tier-2 AI review
  (`## Self-enforcement`).
- **scripts/ci/**, **.github/**, **.githooks/**, **maintenance.jsonl** —
  the self-enforcement layer (`## Self-enforcement`).

## Self-hosting layout

This repo is consumed as `~/.claude`, so the directory that is `.claude/`
in a normal project is the repo root here. Foundational DEV files
(`REQUIREMENTS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `MAINTENANCE.md`, `plans/`) sit at
the root, not in a nested `.claude/`. The nested `.claude/` holds only Claude Code's
project settings, whose location is fixed by the tool.

## Tree-map

All configuration dirs and files. Harness-managed state (`projects/`,
`cache/`, `shell-snapshots/`, `plugins/`, logs, …) is gitignored and
excluded — see `.gitignore`.

```

Project-specific skills symlinked into `skills/` from external repos
(currently the two wallarm-* ones from `~/wallarm_pure/skills`) are not
part of this configuration: gitignored, excluded from the map, versioned
in their own repo.

## Planning model

Self-development uses the planning hierarchy per `skills/dev/plan.md`,
unchanged — structure is never simplified, only description detail.

## Git & delivery model

Trunk-based development: `main` is the protected, always-releasable
trunk; every change lands via a short-lived branch and a CI-gated PR,
no long-lived branches (`rules/git-workflow.md`).

The unit of delivery is the **batch** — one or more tasks that must land
together to keep `main` coherent, shipped as one PR (a lone task is a
batch of one; coupled tasks integrate on a short-lived `batch/B-XXX`).
Mode is orthogonal — delivery is uniform, verification differs (auto:
agentic checkpoint; manual: human PR review). Releases tag the trunk, no
release branch (`skills/dev/branch-plan.md § Agentic execution`).

Standard: Trunk-Based Development / GitHub Flow (trunkbaseddevelopment.com,
dora.dev); tag-on-trunk releases (Pro Git, git-scm.com); coherence via
feature flags / branch-by-abstraction (Fowler); host enforcement per
GitHub Docs.

## Self-enforcement

Two tiers gate every change into `main` (the CI tiers are built for
`~/.claude`; the PreToolUse hooks ship to adopters via `install-dev.sh`):

- **Tier-1 — mechanical CI.** `scripts/ci/*.sh` (run by
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on `pull_request`, and locally by the
  advisory `.githooks/pre-push` via `core.hooksPath`) hard-fail a PR on:
  a cap violation, a stray top-level file, a plan-integrity break, a
  `TODO`/`FIXME`/`XXX` marker in code, an expired reference, or a
  missing ledger stamp.
- **Tier-2 — AI review.** `MAINTENANCE.md § Tier-2 AI review` applies the
  rule set (compliance, cross-file integrity, cleanup, reference
  freshness) to the diff and appends a stamp to `maintenance.jsonl` — an
  append-only ledger keyed by content-tip SHA (union-merged, so
  concurrent stamps don't conflict). `check-ledger.sh` (Tier-1) refuses
  any PR whose delivered tree lacks a clear stamp.

The workflow triggers on `pull_request` only, so it never re-judges the
direct-to-main bootstrap history.

Ahead of both tiers, PreToolUse hooks (`dev-branch-guard`,
`dev-secrets-guard`) add a local pre-emptive guard: no writes or commits on
the trunk, and no secrets into tracked files or commits.

## Invariants

- Every skill is reachable, documented, and non-duplicative.
- No workflow contains a dead-end or an unbounded loop.
- Rules and CLAUDE.md reference only existing paths.
- Serial DEV behaviors stay behaviorally unchanged unless a REQ changes
  them.

## Decisions

Architecture Decision Records, when needed, live in `adr/` (lazy,
per `skills/dev/layout.md`).
